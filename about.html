<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Satyam Yadav, an 18-year-old computer science student hailing from Maharashtra,<br/>
  India. I'm passionate about web development and currently honing my skills in this exciting<br/>
  field. Building my own portfolio is one of my top priorities as it allows me to showcase my<br/>
  work and demonstrate my growth as a developer.</p>

<p>As a young and enthusiastic web developer, I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and <br/>
  expertise. Being a computer science student, I have a solid foundation to build upon. I <br/>
  believe that continuous learning is key in this ever-evolving industry, and I'm excited <br/>
  to contribute my skills to the world of technology.</p>

<p>Living in the vibrant state of Maharashtra, India, has exposed me to diverse cultures <br/>
  and perspectives, which I believe enriches my creativity as a web developer. I am determined <br/>
  to make a mark in the field and look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead on <br/>
  my journey in web development.</p>
